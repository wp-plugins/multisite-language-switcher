A simple, powerful and easy to use plugin that will help you to 
manage multilingual content in a multisite WordPress installation.

== Description ==

A simple, powerful and easy to use plugin that will add 
multilingual support to a WordPress 
[multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) 
installation, i.e. multiple subdomains or folders (if you need to 
set up multiple sites across multiple domains, you'll also want to 
use the
[WordPress MU Domain Mapping](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/)
plugin as well - as long as the domains are all hosted on the 
same server.).

The Multisite Language Switcher enables you to manage translations of 
posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

The plugin uses flag-icons from [FamFamFam](http://famfamfam.com). 
Thanks to Mark James for his great work. In addition I would like to 
thank [Jürgen Mayer](http://blog.jrmayer.co/) for creating the plugin's 
banner.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an 
existing one, you can [send me](mailto:re@lloc.de) your gettext PO 
and MO so that I can bundle it into the Multisite Language Switcher. 
You can download the latest POT file
[from here](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/multisite-language-switcher/trunk/languages/default.pot).

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin and uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme 
* Copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins) 
* Activate the plugin in your plugin administration page 
* Set the configuration in Options -> Multisite Language Switcher 

Now you can: 

* connect your translated pages and posts in Posts -> Edit or Page -> Edit 
* connect your translated categories and tags in Posts -> Categories or Post -> Tags
* connect your Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies across languages
* use a widget and/or a content_filter which displays a hint to the user if a translation is available 
* optionally you can place the code `<?php if ( function_exists( 'the_msls' ) ) the_msls(); ?>` directly in your theme files

[Multisite Language Switcher Wiki](https://github.com/lloc/Multisite-Language-Switcher/wiki)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a function I can call to get the language of the page the user is currently viewing? =

Yes, you can get the language like that

`$blog     = MslsBlogCollection::instance()->get_current_blog();
$language = $blog->get_language();`

= I have no language options in the General settings. =

You might read first [WordPress in your language](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language).

= But I'd like the interface to stay in English. =

You could check out the plugin [Native Dashboard](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-native-dashboard/).

= Do I really need a multisite? =

It's up to you - of course. Yes, if you want to use the Multisite Language Switcher.
