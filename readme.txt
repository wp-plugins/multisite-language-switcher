== Description ==

A simple but powerful plugin that will help you to manage the relations of posts, pages, categories and tags in your multisite-multilingual-installation.

The plugin is using the flag-icons from [FamFamFam](http://famfamfam.com). Thanks to Mark James for his great work.

= Translators =
* German (de_DE) - [Dennis Ploetner](http://www.urlaub-und-reisen.net/)
* Italian (it_IT) - [Antonella Cucinelli](http://www.freely.de/it/)
* Dutch (nl_NL) - [Alexandra Kleijn](http://www.buurtaal.de/)
* Brazillian Portuguese (pt_BR) - [Victor](http://www.coolweb.com.br/)
* Spanish (es_ES) - [Andreas Breitschopp](http://www.ab-weblog.com/en/)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can [send me](mailto:re@lloc.de) your gettext PO and MO so that I can bundle it into the Multisite Language Switcher. You can download the latest POT file [from here](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/multisite-language-switcher/trunk/languages/default.pot).

== Installation ==

* download the plugin
* uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme
* copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your wordpress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* activate the plugin in your plugin page
* set some configuration in Options -> Multisite Language Switcher
* set the relations of your pages and posts in Posts -> Edit or Page -> Edit
* set the relations of your categories and tags in Posts -> Categories or Post -> Tags
* now you can use the widget and/or the content_filter which displays a hint if a translation is available
* optionally you can use a line like `<?php if ( function_exists( 'the_msls' )) the_msls(); ?>` directly in your theme-files
